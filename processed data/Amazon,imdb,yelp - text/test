0|If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.
1|If you are Razr owner...you must have this!
0|Needless to say, I wasted my money.
0|What a waste of money and time!.
1|And the sound quality is great.
1|He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.
0|If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.
1|Very good quality though
0|The design is very odd, as the ear "clip" is not very comfortable at all.
1|Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.
0|I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!
1|So Far So Good!.
1|Works great!.
0|It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.
0|I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.
1|I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!
0|The commercials are the most misleading.

0|Doesn't hold charge.
0|This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.
1|This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.

1|It has all the features I want
0|Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.
0|AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.
1|This case seems well made.
0|Disappointed with battery.
0|Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.
1|good protection and does not make phone too bulky.
1|A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.
1|This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.
1|I love this thing!
1|Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.
0|VERY DISAPPOINTED.
1|I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!
1|I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.
0|The buttons for on and off are bad.
0|Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.
1|I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.
1|These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.
0|Buy a different phone - but not this.
0|You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.
0|The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.
0|A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.
1|It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.

1|Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.
0|The battery runs down quickly.
0|This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.
1|The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.
1|This phone works great.
0|The construction of the headsets is poor.
1|Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!
1|The phone loads super!
0|For a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.
1|Made very sturdy.
1|Worked great!.
0|The ear buds only play music in one ear.
0|Dont waste your money...
1|Will order from them again!
0|If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.
0|I found this product to be waaay too big.
1|Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.
0|I'm very disappointed with my decision.
1|Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.
0|Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.
1|Definitely a bargain.
1|The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.
0|I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.
1|Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.
0|That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).
1|I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.
0|The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.
0|I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.
1|Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.
1|This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.
1|its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.
1|Great product, fast shipping!.
1|Absolutely great.
1|The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.
0|i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.
1|It is very comfortable on the ear.
1|It has been a winner for us.
1|)Setup couldn't have been simpler.
1|I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.
0|Could not get strong enough signal.
1|Iam very pleased with my purchase.
0|Bad Quality.
1|Gets the job done.
1|Great audio!.
0|Basically the service was very bad.
0|it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.
1|I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.
0|The BT headset was such a disapoinment.
1|It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.
1|The accompanied software is almost brilliant.
1|Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.
1|!I definitly recommend!!
0|Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.
0|The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.
1|Very good stuff for the price.
1|My headset works just peachy-keen.
0|In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.
1|Voice recognition is tremendous!
0|What a waste.
0|During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.
0|I was not happy with this item.
0|very disappointed.
0|The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.
1|I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.
0|What a waste of time!
0|Its reception is very very poor.
0|Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.
0|After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.
0|I Was Hoping for More.
0|Audio Quality is poor, very poor.
1|I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!
1|I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.
0|I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.
1|This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.
1|Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.
1|This item is fantastic and works perfectly!
1|And I just love the colors!
1|W810i is just SUPERB.
0|All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.
1|Great charger.
0|This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.
1|Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.
0|I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.
1|Great Value.
0|Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.
1|The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.
0|doesn't last long.
0|One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.
1|EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.
0|Thank you for wasting my money.
0|How can that be?The audio quality is poor.
1|The iGo chargers and tips are really great.
1|The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.
1|Superb Phone on a Great Network.
1|I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.
0|I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.
0|It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.
0|If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!
0|Don't buy this product.
0|I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.
1|The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.
0|I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.
0|I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.
1|Incredible!.
0|Design Flaw?.
1|Great phone!.
0|Waste of 13 bucks.
0|But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.
0|The replacement died in a few weeks.
1|Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..
1|Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.
0|I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.
0|Not impressed.
1|Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.
1|You'll love how thin it is.
0|Bad Choice.
0|The pleather case doesn't fit.
0|useless phone, simply deaf.
0|A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  
0|Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  
0|Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  
0|Very little music or anything to speak of.  
1|The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  
0|The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  
0|Wasted two hours.  
1|Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  
0|A bit predictable.  
1|Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  
1|And those baby owls were adorable.  
1|The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  
1|The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  
1|It Was So Cool.  
1|This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  
0|It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  
1|This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  
1|I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  
1|It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces.  
1|" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  
1|I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  
1|In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  
1|How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  
1|It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  
1|Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  
0|This short film certainly pulls no punches.  
0|Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  
1|This is the number one best TH game in the series.  
1|It deserves strong love.  
1|It is an insane game.  
1|There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  
1|Waste your money on this game.  
1|This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
1|Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  
0|Today the graphics are crap.  
1|As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  
1|This game rocks.  
1|Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  
1|It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  
0|This was a flick doomed from its conception.  
0|The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  
0|I wasn't the least bit interested.  
0|Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  
0|But it's just not funny.  
0|But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  
0|His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  
0|The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  
0|The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  
0|But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  
1|The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  
1|I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  
1|In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  
1|It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  
0|On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  
0|Long, whiny and pointless.  
0|But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  
1|Excellent cast, story line, performances.  
1|Totally believable.  
1|Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  
1|Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  
1|I sat riveted to the TV screen.  
1|All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  
1|I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  
1|I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  
0|I was very disappointed in the movie.  
0|One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  
0|There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  
0|There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  
0|This movie totally grates on my nerves.  
0|The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  
0|And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  
0|Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  
0|It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  
1|There are some generally great things in it.  
0|I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  
1|The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  
1|I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  
1|If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  
1|Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  
1|He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  
0|I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec.  
1|This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  
1|If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  
1|Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  
1|Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  
1|Give this one a look.  
1|I gave it a 10  
1|The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  
1|It is a true classic.  
1|It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  
1|Definitely worth checking out.  
0|The problem was the script.  
0|It was horrendous.  
0|There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  
0|The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  
1|MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  
1|The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  
1|The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  
1|Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  
1|If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  
1|I don't think you will be disappointed.  
0|Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  
0|The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  
0|It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  
0|Too politically correct.  
0|Very disappointing.  
1|The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  
0|I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  
0|An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  
1|But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  
1|The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  
0|The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  
0|The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  
0|), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  
0|The directing seems too pretentious.  
0|The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  
0|And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  
0|Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  
1|Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  
1|I really liked that.  
1|A great film by a great director.  
1|The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  
1|The music in the film is really nice too.  
1|I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  
1|Brilliant!  
1|10/10  
1|I liked this movie way too much.  
0|My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  
1|It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  
0|However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  
0|There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  
0|There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  
0|This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  
0|All in all, a great disappointment.  
0|I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  
0|I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  
0|I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  
0|IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  
0|I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  
0|Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  
0|These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
0|All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  
0|It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  
0|You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  
1|This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  
0|This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  
0|The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  
0|A truly, truly bad film.  
0|The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  
0|The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  
0|I paid too much.  
1|Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  
0|It was so BORING!  
0|No plot whatsoever!  
0|Again, no plot at all.  
0|Horrible!  
0|Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  
0|I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  
0|I hate movies like that.  
0|Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  
0|THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  
0|If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  
0|Awful.  
0|I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  
0|It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  
0|NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  
0|This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  
0|Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  
1|Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  
0|Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  
0|I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  
0|This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  
0|I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  
0|I mean this in a terrible way.  
0|This film has no redeeming features.  
0|Everything is appalling.  
0|Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  
0|The story is beyond stupid.  
0|The script iswas there a script?  
0|The kids are annoying.  
0|The lead man is charisma-free.  
0|Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  
0|I'll even say it again  this is torture.  
0|Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  
0|Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  
0|Highly unrecommended.  
0|If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  
0|Yes, it's that bad.  
0|Nothing at all to recommend.  
1|An excellent performance from Ms.  
1|Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  
1|It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  
0|This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  
0|There were too many close ups.  
0|But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  
0|But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  
1|"You'll love it!  
0|This movie is BAD.  
0|So bad.  
0|The film is way too long.  
0|I'm super pissd.
1|And service was super friendly.
0|Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?
1|This place was such a nice surprise!
1|They were golden-crispy and delicious.
0|I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.
1|I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
0|Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
1|Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.
1|The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.

0|Weird vibe from owners.
0|There was hardly any meat.
0|I've had better bagels from the grocery store.
1|Go To Place for Gyros.

0|I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
0|The service was terrible, food was mediocre.
1|We definately enjoyed ourselves.

0|I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.
0|The service was extremely slow.

0|Spend your money elsewhere.
1|Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!
0|The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
0|And the drinks are WEAK, people!
0|-My order was not correct.
0|Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.
0|After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
1|The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0|We won't be returning.
1|This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
0|I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
0|Very, very sad.
0|i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?
0|How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!
0|I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
0|The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
0|There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better
0|I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
0|They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
0|What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.
0|Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.
0|This place is disgusting!
1|Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.
0|The RI style calamari was a joke.
0|However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.
0|I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.
0|It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.
0|It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
0|We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
0|Disappointing experience.
0|The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.
0|If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.
0|WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
0|We won't be going back.
0|The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
0|This place lacked style!!
0|The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.
0|Don't bother coming here.
0|The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.
0|The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.
0|It was equally awful.
0|Probably not in a hurry to go back.
0|very slow at seating even with reservation.
0|Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
0|The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
0|The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.
0|It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.
0|I was VERY disappointed!!
0|This place is horrible and way overpriced.
0|Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.
0|It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
0|The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
0|The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.
0|Con: spotty service.
0|The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.
0|But then they came back cold.
0|Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.
0|The real disappointment was our waiter.
0|My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
0|The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
0|Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.
0|If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
0|She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
0|After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
0|Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
0|It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
0|But I don't like it.
0|Hell no will I go back
0|We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
0|I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".
0|I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
0|The ambiance isn't much better.
0|Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
0|The food wasn't good.
0|Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.
0|What happened next was pretty....off putting.
0|too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.
0|Overpriced for what you are getting.
0|I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
0|I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.
0|I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.
0|We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
0|Food was below average.
0|It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
0|All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.
0|The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
0|Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
0|It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.
0|It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
0|I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
0|The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
0|Spend your money and time some place else.
0|A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
0|the presentation of the food was awful.
0|I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
0|I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
0|Appetite instantly gone.
0|Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
0|The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.
0|Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.
